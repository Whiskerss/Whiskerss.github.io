            <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Research</h1>
            <p class="content">I had no idea what a portfolio website should look like before creating this one. That's
                why I needed to do some research and find some examples. After doing some research, I found some
                websites that inspired me to create something similar. Here are the websites from which I drew
                inspiration.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>1. Navigation Bar</h2>
            <img src="../images/ref1.png" alt="Navigation Reference">
            <img src="../images/imple1.png" alt="Navigation Implementation">
            <p class="content">The navigation bar I have made in my website was inspired from <a class="link"
                    href="https://underbelly.is/writing-about">Underbelly.is</a>. As you can see there are some
                similarities such as the logo and the orientation of the navigation bar. As hard as I tried, i could not
                make the navigation bar as good as theirs. I included a background colour which I think fits better in
                my website.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>2. Home Page</h2>
            <!-- 
                Video tag used to embed videos
                Video plays on clicking them
             -->
            <video id="video" onclick="play()" autoplay>
                <source src="../video/ref2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <video id="video" onclick="play()">
                <source src="../video/imple2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>

            <p class="content"> The big background in the homepage in my website was inspired by <a class="link"
                    href="https://yanick.co/">yanick.co</a>. The big background with a logo in the middle looks quite
                good in the website. Although they both look similar, there are quite some differences. The
                backgorund in my website is parallax and the logo is very much different. You can see the differences by
                clicking on the videos to play them. </p>
            <br>

            <h2>3. Newsletter Banner</h2>
            <img src="../images/ref3.png" alt="Newsletter Reference">
            <img src="../images/imple3.png" alt="Navigation Implementation">
            <p class="content">This Newsletter banner from <a class="link"
                    href="https://nordiceye.com/">nordiceye.com</a> immediately caught my attention when I first visited
                their site. I found it as a very creative way to catch attention and tried to make one for my own
                website. Although my form as quite some differences in terms of form validation and the way of
                presenting error message is quite different as well. </p>
            <br>

            <h2>4. Copyright Column</h2>
            <img src="../images/ref4.png" alt="Copyright Reference">
            <img src="../images/imple4.png" alt="Copyright Implementation">
            <p class="content">The idea of putting social media icons in the footer section came from <a class="link"
                    href="https://toyfight.co/">toyfight.co</a>. It is a great way to promote one's social media
                accounts and makes them easily accessible to the visitors.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>5. Contact Form</h2>
            <img src="../images/ref5.png" alt="Conact From Reference">
            <img src="../images/imple5.png" alt="Contact Form Implementation">
            <p class="content">The contact form in <a class="link"
                    href="https://www.ashevilleluxuryelopements.com/contact-us/">ashevilleluxuryelopements.com</a>
                looked very attractive to me as it is simple yet looks very good to the eyes. I took a very liking to
                this idea and tried to make a contact page of my own in my website. It is a great way to get feedback
                from visitors and clients. </p>
